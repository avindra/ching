This archive is derived from the original SCCS repository maintained by
the Computer Systems Research group.  The project began using a source
code control system (SCCS) in 1980 (three years after Bill Joy began his
initial Berkeley UNIX development).  Initially only the kernel was put
under SCCS, but by 1983 everything had been put under SCCS.
